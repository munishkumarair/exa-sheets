# Key obervations:
- Sample run for 160 cells 
- 20 companies X 8 columns
- Took ~10 minutes to run completely 
- 21 blanks of total 160 cells, across
    - Website(6)
    - HQ(8)
    - Headcount(6)
   
# Key learnings:
- Need to fine tune the prompts
    - could categorize prompts for the values 
        - financial
        - employee count
        - Website
        - HQ, etc.
- Can add specific sources for some prompts
    - Need to evaluate what sources can be extracted efficiently
- Add years to the query wherever applicable
- Multi year scraping might be a possible task - to explore feasibility for that
- Need to create schema to contain:
    - Answer to the query
    - Sources

# Ask from Giordano
- Focus on specific use cases 
    - Need samples of what we need to do for most of the cases since general prompting may not suffice
    - Ask if the sources are necessary or can be pruned if not requried at all
    - I think there is 50% hit chance when using this
